# Computer Vision for Tie/Ballast Detection

In this project, Computer Vision is applied for image classification, enabling the autonomous identification of crossties and ballast, pivotal components in railroad tracks. A GoPro camera, affixed to a remotely controlled rail cart and positioned facing downward for a top-down view of the track, captures the necessary visual data. The recorded videos serve as training data for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This system demonstrates the capability to dynamically and autonomously locate ties and ballast during operation.
